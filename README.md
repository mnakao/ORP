## How to create libraries
```
$ cd ORP
$ make [serial|threads|all]
```

## How to use libraries
In order to create the executable, you need to include the header file `./include/orp.h` and link it with one of the libraries.

## How to compile sample programs
```
$ cd ORP/sample
$ make [serial|threads|all]
```

## File format for graph
* The first line describes the number of hosts (h), the number of switches (s), and the radix of the switches (r).
* The hosts must be integers 0, 1, 2, ..., h-2, h-1.
* The switches must be integers h, h+1, h+2, ..., h+s-2, h+s-1.
* The switch can have up to r edges.
* From the second line, describe the vertex numbers (from 0 to h+s-1) of the start and end points of the edge.
* The switch connects to the host or switch.
* The host cannot connect to the host.
* For example, see "sample/graph/".

Following figure and its edge file are examples of a graph (h = 15, s = 4, r = 6), which is referred to ref. [1].

## Environment variable
### ORP_ASPL=BFS

This library provides two algorithms for ASPL.
The default setting calculates the APSL with the matrix method.
Apart from that, it also provides a method using breadth-first search (BFS).
While the matrix method is faster, the BFS method consumes less memory.
In default setting, the matrix method is used.
In case of ORP_ASPL=BFS, BFS is used.

### ORP_PROFILE=1

Output the performance profile for ORP_Set_aspl(). 
This profile is output when ORP_Finalize_aspl() is executed.
```
$ ORP_ASPL=BFS ORP_PROFILE=1 ./simple.x ./graph/h32s26r4.edges
------ Profile for SET_ASPL ------
Date            = Thu May  6 17:49:08 2021
Hostname        = crimson.r-ccs27.riken.jp
Number of Times = 1
Total Time      = 0.000026 sec.
Average Time    = 0.000026 sec.
Algorithm       = BFS (SERIAL)
Memory Usage    = 0.000 MB
Num of Threads  = 1
--------- End of Profile ---------
Hosts = 32, Switches 26, Radix = 4
Diameter     = 11
Diameter Gap = 6 (11 - 5)
ASPL         = 5.9677419355 (2960/496)
ASPL Gap     = 1.7741935484 (5.9677419355 - 4.1935483871)
```

The meaning of each item in the profile is as follows.
* Date : The time when the profile was output.
* Hostname : Name of the machine on which the program ran.
* Number of Times : Number of times ORP_Set_aspl() was executed.
* Total Time : Total execution time of ORP_Set_aspl().
* Average Time : Average execution time of ORP_Set_aspl().
* Algorithm : MATRIX or BFS. The parentheses are the types of libraries used. That is, SERIAL or THREADS.
* Memory Usage : Estimated ammount of memory used in the library.
* Num of Threads : Number of threads used in the library.

## Basic Function
### Overview
Basic function calculates ASPL and diameter of a graph.
```
#include "orp.h"

int main()
{
  ...
  ORP_Init_aspl(...);
  for(int i=0;i<ITERATIONS;i++){
    /* Optimization */
    ORP_Set_aspl(...);
  }
  ORP_Finalize_aspl();
  ...
  return 0;
}
```
ORP_Set_aspl() calculates APSL and diameter of a graph.
While ORP_Init_aspl() initializes for ORP_Set_aspl(), ORP_Finalize_aspl() finalizes for ORP_Set_aspl().
Thus, ORP_Set_aspl() should be called between ORP_Init_aspl() and ORP_Finalize_aspl().
Note that ORP_Init_aspl() and ORP_Finalize_aspl() will basically be called only once each in a program.

### Initialize
Perform the initialization process before executing ORP_Set_aspl().
```
void ORP_Init_aspl(int hosts, int switches, int radix)
```
* [IN] hosts : Number of hosts.
* [IN] switches: Number of switches.
* [IN] radix : Radix of the switch.

### Set diameter, sum, and ASPL
Set diameter, sum, and ASPL. 
In the case of an unconnected graph, INT_MAX, LONG_MAX, and DBL_MAX are assigned to the values of diameter, sum, and ASPL, respectively.
```
void ORP_Set_aspl(int h_degree[switches], int s_degree[switches], int adjacency[switches][radix], int *diameter, long *sum, double *ASPL)
```
* [IN] h_degree : Number of hosts connected to each switch.
* [IN] s_degree : Number of switches connected to each switch.
* [IN] adjacency : Adjacency matrix.
* [OUT] diameter : Diameter of a graph.
* [OUT] sum : Total value of the distances between each host in a graph.
* [OUT] ASPL : Average shortest path length of a graph (sum = ASPL*(hosts*(hosts-1)/2)).

In the case of the above figure, h_degree, s_degree and adjacency are as follows.
* h_degree[] = {4, 3, 4, 4}
* s_degree[] = {1, 3, 2, 2}
* adjacency[][] = {{1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1},{0,2,3,-1,-1,-1},{1,3,-1,-1,-1,-1},{1,2,-1,-1,-1,-1}}

"h_degree[0]=4" means that s0 connects to four hosts.
"s_degree[1]=3" means that s1 connects to three switches.
"adjacency[2][]={1,3,-1,-1,-1,-1}" means that s2 connects to s1 and s3 (-1 means no value).

### Finalize
Release the resources allocated in ORP_Init_aspl().
```
void ORP_Finalize_aspl()
```

## Utility
### Read a property of a file
```
void ORP_Read_property(char* fname, int* host, int* switches, int* radix, int *lines)
```
* [IN] fname : File name of a graph.
* [OUT] hosts : Number of hosts.
* [OUT] switches : Number of switches.
* [OUT] radix : Radix of the switch.
* [OUT] lines : Number of lines in an edge list.

### Read an edge from a file
```
void ORP_Read_edge(char* fname, int edge[lines][2])
```
* [IN] fname : File name of a graph.
* [OUT] edge : Edge list.

In the case of the above figure, lines and edge are as follows.
* lines = 19
* edge[][] = {{0,15},{5,15},{6,15},{7,15},{1,16},{8,16},{9,16},{2,17},{10,17},{11,17},{12,17},{3,18},{4,18},{13,18},{14,18},{15,16},{16,17},{16,18},{17,18}}

## A graph with symmetry
Symmetry in this library means that the original graph matches when the graph is rotated `360/symmetries` degrees.
Therefore, a value of `symmetries` must be a divisor of `hosts` and `switches`.
When `symmetries=1`, target the graph without symmetry.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mnakao/ORP-misc/main/img/sample_s.png)

The image is an example of a graph with (hosts, switches, radix, symmetries) = (9, 6, 5, 3).
The adjacency matrix of switch can be divided into three groups (`= symmetries`).
The values on the 2nd row are 0, 3, and 5.
It means that the switch S1 has three edges, S1-S0, S1-S3, and S1-S5.
The edges plus 2 (`= switches/symmetries`) matches the 2nd row in the next group (in line 4).
0 + 2 = 2 and 3 + 2 = 5.
Here, 5 + 2 = 7, but the number of switches is 6, so it goes around and becomes 7 - 6 = 1.
This rule holds for all groups.

The elements in lins 3-6 of the adjacency matrix can be calculated from those in lines 1-2.
Thus, the new `adjacency matrix'`, in which the red part of `adjacency matrix` is deleted, is used.
The size of the `adjacency matrix'` is `int adjacency[switches/symmetries][radix]`.
Similarly, the sizes of h_degree and s_degree are `int h_degree[switches/symmetries]` and `int s_degree[switches/symmetries]`.
